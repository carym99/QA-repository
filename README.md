👨‍💻 About Me

My name is Rilwan Abdulkareem,  am a Quality Assurance Engineer passionate about delivering high-quality software by combining:

🔍 Manual Testing → exploratory testing, detailed test case design, bug reporting.

🤖 Automation Testing → using Cypress & Playwright for functional, UI, and API testing.

🛠 QA Practices → shift-left testing, regression testing, CI/CD integration, and defect management.

With a background in API testing (Postman, REST API) and test design for edge cases, I strive to uncover hidden bugs and ensure seamless user experiences.
I enjoy working on demo projects that reflect real-world e-commerce and web application testing scenarios.

📂 Portfolio Projects

Here are some of the demo projects I’ve worked on (code and test cases included in respective folders):

1. 🛍 E-commerce Testing – Automation Test Store

✅ Functional Testing → Sign Up, Login, Add to Cart, Checkout.

✅ Negative Testing → invalid emails, broken sessions, payment edge cases.

✅ Automation → Cypress & Playwright test scripts covering UI flows.

2. 🎓 UI Component Testing – WebDriverUni

✅ Automated tests for modals, forms, file uploads, and dynamic elements.

✅ Cross-browser checks with Playwright.

✅ Data-driven tests with fixtures.

3. 🌐 API Testing – Using Postman & Cypress

✅ CRUD operations on demo APIs (e.g., GoRest API).

✅ Environment variables, chaining requests, response validation.
